# ðŸŒ“ Hyperion

The goal is to build a compiler called Hyperion that would compile to bytecode.
To execute the bytecode you need to use the HVM (Hyperion Virtual Machine) will implement a JIT inside of it.

## Step by Step

1. For the start i won't be saving the bytecode anywhere i will just be executing it directly using the HVM (Hyperion Virtual Machine) without any JIT. Then after i build a good language i will build the separate HVM with a JIT.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement the worlds fastest hash table algorithm (https://probablydance.com/2017/02/26/i-wrote-the-fastest-hashtable/)
