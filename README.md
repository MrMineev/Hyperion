# ðŸŒ“ Hyperion

Hyperion is a simple programming language. To import standard libraries, write:

```
import std <name>;
```

To import stuff from other files, write:

```
import module <name>;
```

There are for, while loops:

```
while (condition) {}

for (let i = 0; i < n; inc i) {}
```

In Hyperion, there are the keywords inc and decr. inc adds one to a variable and decr subtracts one from a variable.

To declare a function, use the def keyword:

```
def f(n) {
  return n + 1;
}
```

There are also if statements.

```
if (condition) {
} else {
}
```
